I apologize for the confusion. It appears that the `smbprotocol` library I mentioned earlier is not commonly used, and my previous response was incorrect.

For connecting to a shared folder with a username and password in Python, you can use the `pySMB` library, which is more commonly used for SMB operations. To use this library, you'll need to install it first:

```bash
pip install pySMB
```

Here's an example of how to connect to a shared folder using `pySMB`:

```python
from smb.SMBConnection import SMBConnection

# Define the server's IP address, share folder path, and login credentials
server_ip = '192.168.3.102'
share_folder = 'Devzone'
username = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
domain = ''  # Set to your domain if applicable
conn = SMBConnection(username, password, 'myClient', server_ip, domain=domain, use_ntlm_v2=True)

try:
    # Establish a connection to the server
    conn.connect(server_ip, 139)

    # List files in the shared folder
    files = conn.listPath(share_folder, '/')
    for file in files:
        print(file.filename)

    # Close the connection when done
    conn.close()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Replace `'your_username'` and `'your_password'` with the appropriate login credentials. This script will connect to the shared folder at `\\192.168.3.102\Devzone` and list the files in that directory. Modify the script to perform other file operations or error handling as needed.
